        <div ><p>Whenever someone feels afraid to board a plane for the first time, they are often reassured by the fact that <span class="emphasis">"planes are the safest mode of transport in the world"</span>, and that is correct! In fact, you are 40 times more likely to die in a car accident, and 3 times more likely to die in a train accident. So for the very few fatal plane accidents that do occur, what causes them? Where do they happen and how many have occured? Let's dive into the plane accidents that have occured in Australia in the past century and find out!</p>
